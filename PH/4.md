## Turn off "Failed to load the kernel driver signature" messages.

In some cases, you can observe the system message _Failed to load the kernel driver signature_ which indicates that the executable files are not signed by the same paid developer certificate that the driver is signed to, but this does not interfere with the program.

For turn off this messages, you need to perform a few simple operations:

1. In the copy of the Process, the Hacker that displays this message sets the _SecurityLevel_ security parameter of the driver according to the instructions in step _KProcessHacker_ of the README.md file.
2. Open the Process Hacker settings editor in to menu _Hacker - Options..._ and check the _Advanced_ checkbox (by default is cleared), then open Advanced menu item (by default is hidden and for temporary show this menu item Your needed turn on Advanced checkbox), then open it and change the _EnableKPHWarning_ parameter value from 1 (default) to 0 . Then click _Close_ button to apply the changes.

This window will not appear any more.
