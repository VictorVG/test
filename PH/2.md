2. Old plug-ins is not compatible on PH v3.0 and required update.

**Search Path Used by Windows to Locate a DLL (source - MSDN)**

_With both implicit and explicit linking, Windows first searches for "known DLLs", such as Kernel32.dll and User32.dll. Windows then searches for the DLL's in the following sequence:_

1. The directory where the executable module for the current process is located.
2. The current directory.
3. The Windows system directory. The GetSystemDirectory function retrieves the path of this directory.
4. The Windows directory. The GetWindowsDirectory function retrieves the path of this directory.
5. The directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

_The **LIBPATH** environment variable is not used._

**NOTES!**

* All used plug-ins required update and rebuild use Process Hacker SDK v3.0.5411.884 or letter.
* Any old plug-ins are not compatible with new versions of Process Hacker, and their use will lead to a crash of his completing the task.
* Security Explorer plugin can cause crashes Process Hacker on Windows 10, so the OS is recommended to disable it. If you are using Windows 8.x and you have problems caused by plug-in Security Explorer, open the Hacker menu - Plugins …, locate the Security Explorer plug-ins list and click the Disabled button and then to apply the changes in the settings restart Process Hacker.
* You can also disable any other plug-in, but disable plug-ins is recommended only if the plug-in is causing problems.
* Terminator plugin is designed exclusively for the crash of the processes and threads that can not be completed in the normal way, but you must remember that the abnormal termination of the process (thread) treated their data is not stored that can lead to unpredictable errors in the work of others beyond their processes (threads ).
