## Network traffic control without Firewall Monitor plugin

Since this plugin does not work with all firewalls and not on all operating systems, the question arises: what methods will solve this task?

To solve it, we do not need anything other than setting up the columns of the Network tab by right-clicking on the line with their names, at the bottom of the command Select columns ... and select columns there for the picture:

![fw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/906886/36501643-bd448b78-1758-11e8-92c4-5ccd0dbd56dd.png)

And then everything is just the volumes of data transfer we see, the instant state of the firewall was output to the column, the addresses - the ports are known and visible, everything, the network we have under control, we know what each process does in the system, the main thing is not to switch between tabs - everything is before us.
